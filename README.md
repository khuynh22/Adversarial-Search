# Adversarial-Search

## Welcome to Multi-Agent Pacman
First, play a game of classic Pacman by running the following command:
python pacman.py
and using the arrow keys to move. Now, run the provided  ReflexAgent in  multiAgents.py
python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent
Note that it plays quite poorly even on simple layouts:
python pacman.py -p ReflexAgent -l testClassic
Inspect its code (in  multiAgents.py) and make sure you understand what it's doing.
